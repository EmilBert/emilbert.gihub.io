      During 2022 me and a few of my friends decided to create a game that had been on our minds since 2020. It was an idea we always really loved but were never able to set aside enough time to make it happen. In 2022 we signed up for a course in game development and spent most of our time, even weekends, developing our game. This game became Holmgang and we placed 2nd at the LiU Game Awards. After all the positive response from both the public but also industry professionals we decided that we wanted to fully pursue development of this game. We therefore started StoneTech Games which is our Indie Game studio.
      <br/><br/>
      I am a game developer at the studio as well as the head UI/UX designer, but at a small studio like ours almost everyone does a little bit of everything. We are located at East Sweden Game Norrk√∂ping.

        Outside of school I volunteer at CoderDojo in Norrk√∂ping. Coderdojo is an ideal organization that wants to help further kids' interests in programming and technology. We hold dojos every week where we program together with the kids and teach them programming basics, web development and game development.
        <br/><br/>
        I am the main organizer of these dojos. I keep in contact with our coaches and make sure we have coaches that can attend. I assess and further develop these dojos together with some of our board members.
